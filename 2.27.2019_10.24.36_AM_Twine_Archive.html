It&#39;s very hot and humid outside and the protagonist is running like hell to get there on time. The protagonist, Y does get there on time but passes out from heatstroke the last thing they see is a girl rushing over to help them out.

The lady tells Y that they shouldn&#39;t be running like that in this heat they&#39;re only bound to get hurt.
She asks if they remember their name {insert name prompt here} 
[[enter bad name]] or good name [[begin journey]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="begin journey" tags="" position="1200,700" size="100,100">She grins back and introduces herself, brushing back her hair and revealing some draconic (/demonic) features. And introduces herself.
The protagonist sits up and the girl tells them that they were unconscious for their classes and they missed them all 
{basically unknown to the protagonist when they were unconscious she went through their phone and took all the personal information she could get her hands on, cause you know she going to turn out to be a crazy yandere but secretly she&#39;s just lonely and doesn&#39;t have a soul so she doesn&#39;t exactly have a place in the world}
The protagonist is like, “well shit, i missed the classes on their first day but thanks for helping me out.”
The girl then asks if they want to go check out something (it could be a club, basically we just need a way that will introduce the other two girls in a matter that flows.)
The protagonist can agree or disagree to this.
[[go with demon girl]] (affinity gain) or [[go on your own]]? (affinity loss)
